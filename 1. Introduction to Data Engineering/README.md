# Introduction to Data Engineering

Data Engineering is a crucial component of modern data-driven organizations, ensuring data is collected, processed, stored, and made accessible for analytical and machine learning purposes.

## Data Science Careers



Various roles exist within the data science field, each with distinct responsibilities:

### Research Scientist
- Focuses on discovering new solutions to problems not yet in production.
- Requires strong mathematical expertise.
- Works primarily in theoretical frameworks and publications.

### Data Scientist
- Works with real data to solve business problems using algorithms (primarily in Python).
- Applies existing algorithms rather than researching new ones.
- Bridges the gap between business requirements and technical solutions.

### Data Analyst
- Traditional role focused on analyzing systems and users from a business perspective.
- Responsibilities include data retrieval, preprocessing, and analysis.
- Uses tools like Excel, SQL, and BI tools for visualization.

### Data Engineer
- Responsible for collecting, storing, and making data accessible.
- Ensures analytics results can be delivered to customers.
- Primarily concerned with running data pipelines and ensuring data quality.
- Works with distributed systems and data storage solutions.

### Platform Architect
- Determines the platforms and tools used for data pipelines.
- Decides between cloud and on-premise solutions.
- Evaluates scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### Machine Learning Engineer
- Automates analytics processes developed by data scientists.
- Works closely with data engineers to deploy models into production.
- Focuses on scalability, monitoring, and performance of ML models.

### Full Stack Data Scientists
- Perform tasks across all roles, though this approach can lead to inefficiencies.
- Generally found in startups where roles are blended.
